# Data_analysis_jupyter_notebooks
There are two jupyter notebooks here ie: Mid-program Project and Employee Attrition Data Analysis Project. 

The Mid-program Project involves predicting Cab Bookings for a Cab Booking Company having the hourly-data collected on the 
number of Bookings from their App using models like GradientBoosting, RandomForest etc. It contains many visualizations and 
insights gathered along with it. Many Data pre-processing techniques are performed to arrive at accurate predictions for 
Cab Bookings.

The Employee Attrition data analysis project involves analyzing the reasons for higher attrition rate (firing) during the COVID-19 
spread and identifies which sectors, Departments were hit the most with huge number of firing of workforce. The dataset is taken from
IBM survey conducted with Employees in various Corporations. It was a part of Kaggle competition, the highest ROC-AUC Score of 0.82 was 
achieved using Random Forest Model.
